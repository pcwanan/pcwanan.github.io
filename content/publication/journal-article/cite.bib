  abstract = {Microwave induced thermoacoustic tomography has shown promise for noninvasive and non-ionizing early tumor detection. Nowadays, thermoacoustic reconstruction methods based on deep learning have achieved good and time-efficient results. However, both deep learning methods based on the initial thermoacoustic image and end-to-end methods lack interpretability due to the black-box property of neural networks. In this Letter, we propose an interpretable end-to-end network structure comprising an unrolling part and a super-resolution part. In the unrolling part, a deep unfolding network interprets the iterations of the model-based algorithm based on compressed sensing as layers of the network. Subsequently, a fast and efficient super-resolution neural network maps the low-resolution image into the super-resolution space. Two breast models with different sizes of tumor targets are used for validation. By comparing with the traditional method and the deep learning method, the proposed method demonstrates superior performance in image quality and imaging time. Moreover, the parameters in the network hold physical significance, offering the potential for the interpretable end-to-end network in thermoacoustic imaging.},

  abstract = {Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in women, and early detection of breast cancer is essential for more effective treatment. Recently, microwave-induced thermoacoustic tomography (MITAT) based on compressive sensing has been proven to have great potential as a new detection tool for early breast cancer within low sampling time. However, the traditional MITAT reconstruction method based on compressive sensing requires many computing resources. To find a balance between low computing resources and high-resolution images for the method based on compressive sensing, especially in the environment of a non-uniform tissue, we developed a MITAT based on deep learning (DL-MITAT) imaging scheme compressive sensing-super-resolution thermoacoustic imaging (CS-SRTAI) method which decomposed the single reconstruction step into the initial reconstruction part and the super-resolution part. The initial reconstruction part extracts the necessary physical information into the low-resolution image space. The super-resolution part maps the low-resolution image space to the highresolution image space. Specifically, we proposed a neural network in the super-resolution part. Both numerical simulation and the experiment demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The proposed method achieved 88\% structural similarity index measure within computing resources of 21 s and 1.0 GB for the numerical simulation. Moreover, for the real breast tumor and non-uniform tissue experiment, the CS-SRTAI performs well at recovering the location, size, and number of the tumor within computing resources of 65 s and 1.1 GB. It is worth noting that the proposed DL-MITAT imaging strategy reduces computing resources with great imaging quality. It is promising to use in the fields where the computing resources for imaging are restricted.},
